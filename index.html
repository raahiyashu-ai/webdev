    <p>Technology has dramatically transformed modern education. Online learning platforms allow students from different
        parts
        of the world to access high-quality courses and resources that were previously unavailable. Interactive tools,
        such as
        virtual simulations and educational videos, enhance understanding and engagement, making complex concepts easier
        to
        grasp. Moreover, technology enables personalized learning, allowing students to progress at their own pace based
        on
        their strengths and weaknesses. As a result, education has become more flexible, accessible, and tailored to
        individual
        needs, preparing learners to thrive in a fast-changing world.</p>
